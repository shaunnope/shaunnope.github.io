I'm Sean, an aspiring software developer! I graduated from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in 2024 with a major in Computer Science, and a minor in Artificial Intelligence. I have a keen interest in developing robust digital frameworks and enjoy designing backend services and middleware. I am also well-versed in the applications of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and computer vision.
