Am I Shaun? Nope, I'm Sean! I graduated from the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg) (SUTD) in 2024 with a B.Eng in Computer Science and Design. I have a keen interest in developing robust digital frameworks and enjoy designing backend services and middleware. I am also well-versed in the applications of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and computer vision.
