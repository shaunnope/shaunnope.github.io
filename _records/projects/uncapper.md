A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model for verifying claims related to Singapore's local affairs.
- I designed and implemented the pipeline used for the model, incorporating steps such as document retrieval, summarization, and claim validation by using [Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5). The process was tuned for accuracy and efficiency, and evaluated at each stage.
- Comparing end-to-end performances, the pipeline improved verification accuracy by 20%, as compared to simple LLM prompting without RAG.
