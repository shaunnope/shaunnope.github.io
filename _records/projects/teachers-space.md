In a team of 4, I developed an Android application that facilitates communication between teachers, parents, and students, with a focus on privacy and ease of communication. The main features of the app include messaging, calling, and appointment booking. 
- I implemented a search feature that enables users to quickly find relevant chats, and assisted my team in developing the rendering of messages.
