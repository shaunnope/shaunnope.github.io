A recreation of the game _Bop It!_ on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), developed by me along with 5 other team members. In addition to the classic game mechanics, _BitOp!_ introduces users to binary encoding and bit manipulations through a unqiue scoring system.

- I developed the internal logic for the ALU used in the game, and implemented a comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure the correctness of computations. 
- I was also closely involved in designing the design of the game logic, including the scoring system, as well as the implementation of the game's audio and visual feedback.
