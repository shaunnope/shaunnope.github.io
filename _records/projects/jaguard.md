Leading a team of 5, I recreated Apache ZooKeeper in Go, with a focus on providing the same read and write guarantees, scalability, and fault tolerance offered by the official service.
- I implemented the ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast protocol and the Fast Leader Election algorithm, and rigorously tested and fixed issues relating to fault tolerance within the server cluster, ensuring that the project closely replicated the key design principles of ZooKeeper.
