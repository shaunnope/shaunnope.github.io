My team partnered with [Ascenda Loyalty](https://www.ascenda.com/) to develop a web-based hotel booking application, with an emphasis on speed, robustness, and data security. 
- I developed the backend functionality such as search query handling, request redirection, and managing the secure storage and retrieval of user data.
- In addition to designing the application layout and routing framework, I collaborated closely with team members, providing support to implement and integrate their assigned features into our codebase.
