I helped to integrate a social-distancing module built on OpenPose into a ROS-based robot, allowing it to identify groups of people from a moving camera. The robot was also equipped with a speaker to communicate with them. Additionally, I also developed the website for the project using Gatsby to showcase the project and its progress during the 2022 SUTD Open House.
