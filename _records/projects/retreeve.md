In collaboration with [Chen Wa Landscape](https://chenwa.com.sg/), within a team of 6, I developed a modular green wall system that is safer and easier to use and adopt in various site conditions. 
- I defined the networking protocols to link subsystems such as a robotic module, remote control, and backend server, ensuring seamless communication and data transfer between components to maintain system reliability and efficiency.
- I also integrated multiple hardware and software components, including sensors, actuators, and control systems, to create a cohesive and functional system. Focused on maintaining modularity to facilitate easy upgrades and maintenance.
