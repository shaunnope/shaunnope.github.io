Gained experience in various stages of Machine Learning Operations ([MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps)), including data collection, model training, and deployment. During my internship, I achieved the following:
- Developed an internal tool for exploratory data analysis on image datasets that was integrated into the company's production pipeline within 5 weeks of development.
- Designed a performant model evaluation suite for object detection models that helped to quickly identify prominent failure cases of a model on multiple occasions. Additionally, outlined a roadmap towards a production-ready version of the project.
- Refined a Python module for modular and scalable static report generation, allowing for rapid iteration and implementation of other features within biweekly sprints.
