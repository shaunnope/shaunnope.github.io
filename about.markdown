Hello!

I am an aspiring software developer, currently studying at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. With a keen interest in artificial intelligence, data science and web development, I enjoy the process of developing solutions that meld technology with visual content.

## Projects
- [BitOp!](https://github.com/shaunnope/comp_struc_1d) | *Lucid* (Apr 2022)  
With a team of 6, I recreated the game Bop It! on a field programmable gate array, synthesising knowledge of digital system architecture principles. As a bonus, the game introduces users to binary encoding and bit manipulations through a unqiue scoring system.

- [MOMOBot](https://momobot.opensutd.org/) | *ROS, OpenCV, Gatsby* (Mar 2022)  
I helped to integrate a social-distancing module built on OpenPose into a ROS-based robot, allowing it to identify groups of people from a moving camera. The robot was also equipped with a speaker to communicate with them. Additionally, I also developed the website for the project using Gatsby to showcase the project and its progress during the 2022 SUTD Open House.

## Others

I enjoy learning new languages, natural and constructed alike. Fluent in English and Mandarin, I am currently learning Japanese and Esperanto. I also enjoy various forms of sports, including badminton, bouldering, and swimming.
